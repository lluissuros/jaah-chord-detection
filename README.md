# Chord detection on Jazz Audio-Aligned Harmony(JAAH) dataset

A comparison between two chord detection algorithms provided by Essentia library based on JAAH dataset, which consists of manually transcribed chords annotation of the "The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz". 

## Environment Requirements

To run this notebook, you should have installed following libraries:
* Essentia, https://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/

It's recommended to run on a docker environment, which could be found there: https://github.com/MTG/MIR-toolbox-docker.

Note that we did not include the audio files from JAAH dataset, since it will be avaliable on Dunya soon.
